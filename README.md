# ScoreIndicator

Creates a semi-circular score widget that depicts 5 scores with two extreme ends. One is `GOOD`
and the other is `BAD`. In between, the scales is divided into 5 segments with different color patterns.
At the heart of the widget is an animating stick that rates the user's scores. Works well in FINTECH aps.
